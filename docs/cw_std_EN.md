# Clan War Standard
We have members living in timezones from GMT-8 all the way to GMT+11. We are of different ethnicities. We attack at a different pace. We have different development plans for our main base. We have different level of passion in this game.

It is time for a proper standard. This doesn't apply to war leagues.

## Before war search
Members are responsible for opting in/out before the next war search. Once you're in, you're part of the fleet and responsible to attack. **It's ok to opt-in even if you are upgrading your heroes or plan to do so.**

## Prep day
### By default, your target is your opposite.
You can swap targets with members positioned +-3 in the fleet during this period, but it must be agreed upon by the member.
* For example if you're no7 and upgrading your heroes, you might want to attack a lower target by swapping with 8-10.

You can voluntarily give up an **alt**'s attacks but you must ask a +-3 to take over your opposite. Their 2nd will be treated as a 1st. You might still need to backup later. In that case both attacks are considered 2nd, and the target will be assigned by the co-leader.

You're advised to claim the target.

## First attack
You attack your target within the first 12h.

**Attack asap**, but here is what you should do if you're busy:
* War starts in the midnight/morning: Attack before you go to school/start your day
* In the noon/evening: Attack before you sleep.

If you think your alt can 3\* your main's opposite, you can use your alt to attack it and the original target. Both attacks will count as 1st, while **both of your main attacks will be 2nd**

You can claim a feasible target for **backup** after using your 1st attack.

If you failed to use your 1st attack in time, both attacks will be considered 2nd, but you still need to attack the target if it's not 3\*.

## Second attack
**!!DON'T USE IT IN THE FIRST 12H!!** This ensures a fair gameplay experience for all players.

You can NOT attack opponents that:
* Have a note
* Have been claimed by a member who *used their 1st attack*.

Other than that, you can attack any feasible opponents. If all feasible opponents have been 3\*ed, you can either give up or attack anyone.

You can attack anyone when there's only 1h left.

## Moderation
Violating any rules twice (3 for members not in the discord) in a week results in a ban from cw.  
All target changes must be accepted by the member to be effective.

Depending on the progress, I may allow certain members to use their 2nd earlier.
