# Clan War Standard
We have members living in timezones from GMT-8 all the way to GMT+11. We are of different ethnicities. We attack at a different pace. We have different development plans for our main base. We have different level of passion in this game.

It is time for a proper standard. This doesn't apply to war leagues.

## Before war search
Members are responsible for opting in/out before the next war search. Once you're in, you're part of the fleet and responsible to attack. **It's ok to opt in even if you plan to/are upgrading your heroes**

## Prep day
### By default, your target is your opposite.
You can swap targets with members positioned +-3 in the fleet during this period, but it must be agreed by the member.
* For example if you're no7 and upgrading your heroes, you might want to attack a lower target, swapping with 8-10.

You can voluntarily give up an **alt**'s attacks but you must ask a +-3 to take over your opposite. Their 2nd will be treated as a 1st. You might still need to backup later. In that case both attacks are considered 2nd, with the target assigned by the co-leader.

You're advised to claim the target.

## First attack
You attack your target within the first 12h.

**Attack asap**, but here is what you should do if you're busy:
* War starts in the midnight/morning: Attack before you go to school/start your day
* In the noon/evening: Attack before you sleep.

You can claim a feasible target for **backup** after using your 1st attack.

## Second attack
**!!DON'T USE IT IN THE FIRST 12H!!** This ensures a fair gameplay experience between all players.

You can NOT attack opponents that:
* Has a note
* Claimed by a member who *used their 1st attack*.

Other than that, you can attack any feasible opponents. If all feasible opponents are 3\*ed, you can give up or attack anyone.

You can attack anyone when there's only 1h left.

## Moderation
Violating any rules twice (3 for members not in the discord) in a week results in a ban from cw.  
All target changes must be accepted by the member to be effective.

Depending on the progress, I'll allow certain members to use their 2nd earlier.
